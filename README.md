## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [yes] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [yes] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [yes] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [yes] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [yes] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [yes] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [yes] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I didn't use any outside resources to help me complete my submission. I only used what was available on the prework.md page.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I had two challenges that I encountered in creating this submission. 
One challenge I encountered was that once or twice the preview of my app wasn't working correctly, even though I followed all of 
the directions. It seems I didn't capitalize one of the letters which made the application not work correctly in the current progress.
What I did to overcome it was to copy and paste the code provided to find out if the app will work or not. It did work after I copy
and pasted the code provided, so I investigated where I went wrong by comparing my code to the copy and pasted code provided. 
I quickly found that a letter was not capitalized and changed it. Then my app did work. The second challenge was about figuring out
how to understand the nested conditional logic in the guess function. I knew I could use the information learned from the prework to
solve it, but it was a bit too much. I eventually overcame the struggle by taking a breather and using the flow chart to walk through
the logic. It was quite difficult while I couldn't get past what it meant to complete a turn, so I peeked at the solution provided.
I was very close, but I didn't think to use the guessCounter and compare it to the progress variable. That helped me complete the app.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
This assignment made me think a lot about what I could accomplish with web development. Though, it did make me think of some difficult
questions I cannot answer as of yet. (1) How do I create a business website where people can view items on a page and add them to
a cart. (2) How do I create multiple pages in a website like the checkout page to see the cart items? (3) Then, how do they buy them?
(4) How does one connect purchasing items on a website to complete a transaction? (5) How is an account created on a website?
(6) How does someone insert account information like a password without the website owner knowing it? These questions have me
curious to learn more about web development.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them doing the optional portion of the prework. If I alredy did
the prework, then I would work on making everything better in how I would want the app to be like. I would start with the CSS 
side of things to beautify the game more. I would choose better colors for the buttons, find out how to change the squares into
the original shape of how the game looked like, increase the thickness of the border of the buttons, change the background of 
the page, find out how to rearrange the buttons like in the original game where the start button is in the middle and it is a 
circle in the middle of the 4 buttons, and possibly more. I may add a video example on how to play the game and a high score
list of playes who have played the game and have them sign their name. Perhaps, I would implement the account system I wanted
to learn how to do in my response to number 3. If it was possible to refactor certain functions, then I would have to learn more
about web development and figure out how much more refactoring I could accomplish. Finally, I would document my coding much better.
